# Hi!

**TL;DR - This is just a proof of concept to find my way (or our way, if you want to collaborate) on go**

And that's it! :D

## Installing (Mac & Linux)

* Install Go 
* Clone this repo
* Run `tool/deps.sh` (To download the project dependencies)
* Run `tool/run.sh` (To run the program)
* Play with it! `curl -d "id=123&text=my-first-todo" localhost:3000`

** Have fun! **
